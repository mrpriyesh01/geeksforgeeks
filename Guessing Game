Create a program that allows the user to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The program should keep prompting the user until they guess the correct number.

secret_number = 42

# Simulate a do-while loop
while True:
    # This block of code executes at least once
    user_guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))  # Get user input
    
    if user_guess == secret_number:  # Check if the guess is correct
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
        break  # Exit the loop if the guess is correct
    else:
        print("Try again!")  # Prompt user to try again

# Optional: Code after the loop (if needed)
