Given an array arr, return the second largest distinct element from an array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.
Examples:
Input: arr = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
Input: arr = [10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist so answer is -1.

class Solution:
    def print2largest(self, arr):
        # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the array to a set
        unique_arr = list(set(arr))
        # Step 2: Sort the unique elements
        unique_arr.sort()
        # Step 3: Check if there are at least two distinct elements
        if len(unique_arr) < 2:
            return "No second largest element"  
        # Step 4: Return the second largest element
        return unique_arr[-2]
