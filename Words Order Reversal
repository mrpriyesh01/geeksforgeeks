class Solution:
    
    # Function to reverse words in a given string.
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        # Step 1: Split the string into words by periods
        words = s.split('.')  
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the list of words using two-pointer approach
        left, right = 0, len(words) - 1
        while left < right:
            words[left], words[right] = words[right], words[left]  # Swap words
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        
        # Step 3: Join the reversed words back into a single string with periods
        return '.'.join(words)
