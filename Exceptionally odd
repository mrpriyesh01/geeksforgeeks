Given an array of N positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the exceptional number.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3}
Output: 3
Explaination: 3 occurs three times.

class Solution:
    def getOddOccurrence(self, arr, n):
        result = 0
        for num in arr:
            result ^= num  # XOR each element with the result
        return result

        # code here
