        set_A = set(A)
        set_B = set(B)
        uncommon_chars = []
        # Characters in A but not in B
        for char in set_A:
            if char not in set_B:
                uncommon_chars.append(char)
        # Characters in B but not in A
        for char in set_B:
            if char not in set_A:
                uncommon_chars.append(char)
        # Sort the list of uncommon characters
        uncommon_chars.sort()
        if len(uncommon_chars) == 0:
            return -1
        else:
            return ''.join(uncommon_chars)
