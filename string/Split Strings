Given a string S which consists of alphabets , numbers and special characters. 
You need to write a program to split the strings in three different strings S1, S2 and S3
such that the string S1 will contain all the alphabets present in S , 
the string S2 will contain all the numbers present in S and S3 will contain all special characters present in S.
The strings S1, S2 and S3 should have characters in same order as they appear in input.
Input:
S = geeks01for02geeks03!!!
Output:
geeksforgeeks
010203
!!!
Explanation: The output shows S1, S2 and S3. 

class Solution:
    def splitString(ob, S):
        s1="" # Counter for letters
        s2=""   # Counter for digits
        s3=""   # Counter for other characters
        
        for char in S:
            if char.isalpha():
                s1 += char  # Append to S1 if character is an alphabet
            elif char.isdigit():
                s2 += char  # Append to S2 if character is a digit
            else:
                s3 += char  # Append to S3 if character is a special character
        
        # Return the three strings
        return s1, s2, s3
