Given two strings A and B, find if A is a subsequence of B.

Example 1:

Input:
A = AXY 
B = YADXCP
Output: 0 
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B
as 'Y' appears before 'A'.


code=
class Solution:
    def isSubSequence(self, A, B):
        m,n=len(A),len(B)
        j=0
        for i in range(n):
            if j<m and A[j]==B[i]:
                j+=1       
        return j==m

another method
class solution:
def isSubsequence(Self,A.B):
     m,n=len(A),len(B)
     j=0     #pointer of a
     for i in range(n):
         if j<m and a[j]==b[i]:
             j+=1
      return j==m
