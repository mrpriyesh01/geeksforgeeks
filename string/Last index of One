Given a string s consisting of only '0's and '1's,  find the last index of the '1' present.

Note: If '1' is not present, return "-1"

Examples:

Input: s = 00001
Output: 4
Explanation: Last index of  1 in given string is 4.
Input: s = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, 1 is not present, so output is -1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 106

code=
class Solution:
    def lastIndex(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Loop over the string in reverse to find the last '1'
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == '1':
                return i
        # If no '1' is found, return -1
        return -1
