    def ReverseSort(self, string): 
        # Sort the string in ascending order first
        sorted_str = sorted(string)  # This will sort in ascending order (a to z)
        # Reverse the sorted list of characters
        reversed_str = ''.join(reversed(sorted_str))  # Reverse the sorted list
        return reversed_str
