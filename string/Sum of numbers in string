Output: 24
Explanation: 1 and 23 are numbers in the
string which is added to get the sum as
24.

    def findSum(self,s):

        # Go through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a number
                num += char  # If it is, add it to the current number we're building
            else:
                # If we hit a non-number and we have a number stored
                if num:
                    total_sum += int(num)  # Add the number to the total sum
                    num = ''  # Reset num to start a new number

        # After the loop, if there's still a number in num, add it to total_sum
        if num:
            total_sum += int(num)
        
        return total_sum
