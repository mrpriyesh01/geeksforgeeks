Given a string S of lowercase alphabets, check if it is isogram or not.
An Isogram is a string in which no letter occurs more than once.

Example 1:
Input:
S = machine
Output: 1
Explanation: machine is an isogram
as no letter has appeared twice. Hence
we print 1.
Example 2:

Input:
S = geeks
Output: 0
Explanation: geeks is not an isogram
as 'e' appears twice. Hence we print 0.

code=
class Solution:
    def isIsogram(self, s):
        # Create an empty set to store unique characters
        seen_chars = set()
        # Iterate through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # Check if the character is already in the set
            if char in seen_chars:
                return False  # If it is, the string is not an isogram
            # Add the character to the set
            seen_chars.add(char)
        
        # If no duplicates were found, return True
        return True
