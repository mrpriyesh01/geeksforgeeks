Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if the string 'b' can be obtained by rotating (in any direction) string 'a' by exactly 2 places.

Example 1:
Input:
a = amazon
b = azonam
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
amazon can be rotated anti-clockwise by two places, which will make it as azonam.
Example 2:

Input:
a = geeksforgeeks
b = geeksgeeksfor
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
If we rotate geeksforgeeks by two place in any direction, we won't get geeksgeeksfor.

class Solution:
    def isRotated(self, a, b):
        # Check if lengths are not the same, directly return False (0)
        if len(a) != len(b):
            return 0
        
        # Calculate left and right rotations
        left_rotate = a[2:] + a[:2]
        right_rotate = a[-2:] + a[:-2]
        
        # Check if b matches either of the rotated versions of a
        if b == left_rotate or b == right_rotate:
            return 1  # True as per the problem statement
        else:
            return 0  # False
