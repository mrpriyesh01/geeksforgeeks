Given a string, your task is to reverse the string keeping the spaces intact to their positions.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "Help others"
Output: sreh topleH
Explanation: The space is intact at index 4
while all other characters are reversed.
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: skeegrofskeeg
Explanation: No space present, hence the
entire string is reversed.
