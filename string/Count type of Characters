Given a string S, write a program to count the occurrence of Lowercase characters,
Uppercase characters, Special characters and Numeric values in the string.
Note: There are no white spaces in the string.

Example 1:
Input:
S = "#GeeKs01fOr@gEEks07"
Output:
5
8
4
2
Explanation: There are 5 uppercase characters,
8 lowercase characters, 4 numeric characters
and 2 special characters.
code=
class Solution:
    def count(self, s):
        # Initialize counters for each category
        lower_count = 0
        upper_count = 0
        numeric_count = 0
        special_count = 0

        # Iterate through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            if char.islower():
                lower_count += 1
            elif char.isupper():
                upper_count += 1
            elif char.isdigit():
                numeric_count += 1
            else:
                special_count += 1
        return upper_count, lower_count, numeric_count, special_count
