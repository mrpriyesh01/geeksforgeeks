Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 and an element k. The task is to find the element that would be at the kth position of the combined sorted array.

Examples :
Input: k = 5, arr1[] = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], arr2[] = [1, 4, 8, 10]
Output: 6
Explanation: The final combined sorted array would be - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The 5th element of this array is 6.
code=
class Solution:
    def kthElement(self, k, arr1, arr2):
        combined_array = arr1 + arr2
        combined_array.sort()
        if 1 <= k <= len(combined_array):
            return combined_array[k - 1]
        else:
            return None
