Given two arrays of arr1 and arr2, the task is to calculate the product of the maximum element of the first array arr1, and minimum element of the second array arr2.

Examples :
Input : arr1 = [5, 7, 9, 3, 6, 2],  arr2 = [1, 2, 6, 1, 9]
Output : 9
Explanation: The max in arr1 is 9. The min element in arr2 is 1. The product is 9*1 = 9.
Input : arr1 = [0, 0, 0, 0],  arr2 = [1, 1, 2]
Output : 0


code=
class Solution:
    # Function to find the maximum element from array arr1 and 
    # the minimum element from array arr2 and return their product.
    def find_multiplication(self, arr1, arr2):
        # Find the maximum element in arr1
        max_element = max(arr1)
    
    # Find the minimum element in arr2
        min_element = min(arr2)
    
    # Calculate the product of the maximum and minimum elements
        product = max_element * min_element
    
        return product
