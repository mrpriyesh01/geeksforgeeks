Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.
Examples:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, arr):
        temp = arr[-1]
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]
        arr[0] = temp
