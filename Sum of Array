You are given an integer array arr[]. The task is to find the sum of it.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10
Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3]
Output: 7
Explanation: 1 + 3 + 3 = 7.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 104

EXPLANATION=
Hereâ€™s a very simple explanation of the code that you can use:
Function _sum:
It takes an array (arr) as input.
We start with a sum variable set to 0.
We loop through the array, adding each number to the sum.
After the loop, we return the total sum.

#User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def _sum(self, arr):
        sum = 0  # Initialize the sum variable
        for i in range(len(arr)):  # Loop through the entire array
            sum = sum + arr[i]
        return sum  # Return the sum after the loop completes

    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        ob = Solution()
        ans = ob._sum(arr)
        print(ans)
        tc = tc - 1

# } Driver Code Ends
