Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union. 
The Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays. Return the elements in sorted order.

Example 1:
Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 5, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Explanation: 
Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {2, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 5, arr2[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: 
Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.
Example 3:

Input:
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
m = 5, arr2[] = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 
1 2

class Solution:
    # Function to return a list containing the union of the two arrays.
    def findUnion(self, arr1, arr2, n, m):
        '''
        :param arr1: given sorted array arr1
        :param n: size of sorted array arr1
        :param arr2: given sorted array arr2
        :param m: size of sorted array arr2
        :return: The union of both arrays as a sorted list
        '''
        combinedoftwoarray = arr1 + arr2
        uniqueeele = set(combinedoftwoarray)
        sorted_union = sorted(uniqueeele)
        
        return sorted_union

Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2.
