Given an array arr of size n and you have to tell whether the arr is perfect or not. 
An array is said to be perfect if its reverse array matches the original array. If the arr is perfect then return True else return False.
Example 1:
Input :
n = 5
arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
Output : PERFECT
Explanation:
Here we can see we have [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] if we reverse it we can find [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
which is the same as before.So, the answer is PERFECT.

CODE=

from typing import List


class Solution:
    def isPerfect(self, n : int, arr : List[int]) -> bool:
        # code here
        for i in range(n):
            if arr==arr[::-1]:       
               return True
            else:
                return False
