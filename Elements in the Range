Given an array arr[] containing positive elements. A and B are two numbers defining a range. The task is to check if the array contains all elements in the given range.
Example 1:
Input: N = 7, A = 2, B = 5
arr[] =  {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}
Output: Yes
Explanation: It has elements between 
range 2-5 i.e 2,3,4,5
Example 2:

Input: N = 7, A = 2, B = 6
arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}
Output: No
Explanation: Array does not contain 6.
